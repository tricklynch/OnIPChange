OnIPChange
==========

I have a dynamic IP address so I would like to know when I need to update the DNS records for my server.

This should be run as a daemon. Once completed, it will send an email and an SMS to an address and number specified in config.txt.

Written in "Python". It's like half Python, half BASh.
