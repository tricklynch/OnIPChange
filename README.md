OnIPChange
==========

I have a dynamic IP address so I would like to know when I need to update the DNS records for my server.

This should be run as a daemon. Once completed, it will send an email and an SMS to an address and number specified in config.txt.

Written in "Python". It's like half Python, half BASh.

Looking back, this code scares me. I guess I'll take it as a sign that I've learned a lot since then. Not going to fix it now though because I should probably do real adult things before letting myself start coding tonight
